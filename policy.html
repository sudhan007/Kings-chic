      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        At Prathap Construction, we value your privacy and are committed to
        protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how
        we collect, use, and safeguard the data you provide to us.
      </p>

      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up for our service, we collect your name, email address,
        and delivery address. We also collect information about the clothes you
        submit for ironing, such as the type of garment, fabric, and any special
        instructions or preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we may collect information about your device, such as the
        IP address, browser type, and operating system, to improve our services
        and enhance your user experience.
      </p>

      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We use the information you provide to process your laundry and ironing
        orders, communicate with you about your orders, and deliver your freshly
        pressed clothes back to you. We may also use your information to improve
        our services, conduct internal analytics, respond to customer inquiries
        or requests, and send you promotional offers or updates about PressUp.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have consented to receive marketing communications from us, we
        may use your information to send you newsletters, special offers, or
        other promotional materials related to PressUp's services. You can
        opt-out of receiving these communications at any time by following the
        instructions provided in the emails or by contacting us directly.
      </p>

      <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for
        marketing purposes. However, we may share your information with trusted
        service providers and partners who assist us in operating our business
        and providing our services. These third parties are required to maintain
        the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using it
        for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also disclose your information if required by law, to comply with
        a legal obligation, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of
        PressUp, our customers, or others.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your
        personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
        or destruction. We use encryption technologies, firewalls, and other
        security protocols to safeguard your data. We also regularly review and
        update our security practices to ensure the ongoing protection of your
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and
        we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a security breach occurs, we
        will take appropriate steps to mitigate the situation and notify you if
        required by applicable laws and regulations.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal
        information at any time. You can also opt-out of receiving marketing
        communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions in our
        emails or by contacting us directly.
